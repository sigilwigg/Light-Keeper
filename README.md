# Light Keeper (JS)

**A Game by Pike & Pen:**
- Wyatt H Williams: Code, Gameplay Design, Sprite/Tile Art
- Jacob Murphy: Writing/Worldbuilding, Map Design

**Special Thanks:**
- [Zaebucca](https://twitter.com/zaebucca) for inspiring the artstyle and for a small number of sprites *(which I ripped from Zaebucca's work on Jhoto Redrawn - W.W.)*


## Goal:

Create a game using only vanilla JS, HTML5, and CSS in 6-12 weeks. No external libraries.

**Story?:**

Play as someone in a small village tasked with lighting candles for the dead at night. Lighting each candle lets you read about the dearly departed's life.

The player's candle will dynamically light up the night as they walk around and explore.
